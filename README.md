# Password-Generator
The random password generator generates a random password for users based upon the user input. Once the user click on Generate Password button, user will be asked a series of questions, and finally the user will be given a set of password based on the questions they have answered. 

## Applications Used
This application was built using mainly Javascript, HTML and CSS. The main focus is on utilizing prompts, alerts, and confirm methods. Similarly, we again use Javascript to store user inputs inside of a variable and then use the variable in functions as per our need. This application also requires the use of for loop.
